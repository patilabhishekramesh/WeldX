# AI Welding Defect Detection System

## Overview

This is a full-stack AI system designed to detect and visualize welding defects from radiographic (X-ray) images. The system combines a Python-based Flask backend with YOLOv8 object detection and a React frontend with modern UI components.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Radix UI components with shadcn/ui styling
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration

### Backend Architecture
- **Primary Backend**: Python Flask with CORS enabled
- **AI Model**: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) for object detection
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV and PIL for image manipulation
- **Secondary Backend**: Node.js/Express (development server)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM (configured but not actively used)

### Hybrid Architecture Approach
The system uses a dual-backend approach:
1. **Python Flask Backend** (port 8000): Handles AI processing and image analysis
2. **Node.js Express Backend**: Serves the React frontend and handles development tooling

## Key Components

### Frontend Components
- **Upload Zone**: Drag-and-drop file upload with validation
- **Processing Modal**: Real-time progress tracking during AI analysis
- **Image Analysis**: Visual display of uploaded images with defect overlays
- **Results Panel**: Summary of detected defects with categorization
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive set of accessible components (buttons, dialogs, toasts, etc.)

### Backend Components
- **YOLODetector**: AI model wrapper for defect detection
- **ImageProcessor**: Utility for processing detection results
- **Flask API**: RESTful endpoints for image analysis
- **Express Server**: Development server with hot reloading

### Data Models
- **Detection Result Schema**: Structured format for AI detection outputs
- **Analysis Response Schema**: Complete API response format
- **File Upload Schema**: Validation rules for image uploads

## Data Flow

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads radiographic image through React frontend
2. **Validation**: Client-side validation (file size, format, dimensions)
3. **Processing**: Image sent to Python Flask backend via HTTP POST
4. **AI Analysis**: YOLOv8 model processes image for defect detection
5. **Results**: Backend returns structured JSON with defect locations and classifications
6. **Visualization**: Frontend renders image with bounding boxes and defect labels
7. **Summary**: Analysis panel displays defect statistics and insights

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- React ecosystem (React, React DOM, React Query)
- Radix UI primitives for accessibility
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Wouter for routing
- Date-fns for date manipulation

### Backend Dependencies
- Flask and Flask-CORS for API server
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 for AI model
- OpenCV and PIL for image processing
- NumPy for numerical operations
- Neon Database serverless for PostgreSQL

### Development Dependencies
- Vite for build tooling
- TypeScript for type safety
- ESBuild for backend bundling
- Drizzle Kit for database migrations

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Frontend**: Vite dev server with hot module replacement
- **Backend**: Flask development server with auto-reload
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Neon serverless (configured)

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
- **Backend**: ESBuild bundles Node.js server to `dist/index.js`
- **Python Backend**: Runs independently as Flask application

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment setting (development/production)
